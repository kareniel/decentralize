# Algorithms

- hash cash
- retargeting
- Lamport timestamps

vector clocks
Sharding
consistent hashing


## problems

- leader election
- consensus
- distributed search
- spanning tree generation
- mutual exclusion
- resource allocation


## choice of an appropriate distributed algorithm 

1. the characteristics of the problem
2. characteristics of the system the algorithm will run on 
    - type and probability of processor or link failures
    - the kind of inter-process communication that can be performed
    - level of timing synchronization between separate processes
